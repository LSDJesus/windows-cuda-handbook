# Windows CUDA Development Guides

> **üõ†Ô∏è Comprehensive collection of Windows CUDA development guides for AI/ML libraries**
>
> A curated collection of professional guides covering Windows CUDA development, troubleshooting, and optimization for popular AI/ML libraries including PyTorch, Mamba-SSM, Flash-Attention, xFormers, and more.

## üì¶ Prebuilt Wheels

This repository includes prebuilt wheel files for common CUDA-enabled packages. These are stored using **Git LFS** with Google Cloud Storage backend to keep repository sizes manageable.

### üö´ Automatic Download Disabled

By default, wheel files in the `wheel/` directory are **not downloaded** when cloning this repository. This prevents large downloads for users who only need the documentation.

**Configuration applied:**
- `git config lfs.fetchexclude "wheel/"` - Excludes wheel directory from automatic fetches
- `git config lfs.pullexclude "wheel/"` - Excludes wheel directory from automatic pulls

### üì• Downloading Wheels When Needed

If you need the prebuilt wheels:

```bash
# Download all wheel files
git lfs pull --include="wheel/"

# Or download everything
git lfs pull
```

To re-enable automatic downloads for wheel files:
```bash
git config lfs.fetchexclude ""
git config lfs.pullexclude ""
```

### üîß Repository Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LSDJesus/windows-cuda-handbook.git
cd windows-cuda-handbook

# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Optional: Download wheel files
git lfs pull --include="wheel/"
```
